How to Interact with Windows API Functions in PowerShell
========================================================

Windows PowerShell is an object-oriented scripting environment. It is based on the platform of .NET Framework. PowerShell uses .NET classes with their properties and methods. This command shell is helpful for system maintenance tasks, setting up servers, software installation and automated network administration.

But there are specific low-level tasks, which are beyond the standard functionality of Windows PowerShell. They refer to the functions of Windows API defined in the system dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). Although it is not possible to call WinAPI functions directly, there are three common ways to make their methods available in the current session of PowerShell:

-	Add-Type cmdlet
-	Extraction of private .NET methods
-	Reflection

Using Add-Type
---------------

The **Add-Type** cmdlet allows to compile the source code of the required Windows API function in C# and to apply a static .NET method in the current PowerShell session.

Using the **Add-Type** cmdlet requires knowing the data types and parameters of the Windows API function. Such information can be obtained from Microsoft documentation. E.g., the `ShowWindowAsync <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-showwindowasync>`_ function has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: C++

    BOOL ShowWindowAsync(
      HWND hWnd,
      int  nCmdShow
    );

This function has BOOL return value and two parameters – a handle to  the window **hWnd** and an integer **nCmdShow**.

In order to call a WinAPI function in PowerShell environment, a C# wrapper is needed. The website
`pinvoke.net <http://www.pinvoke.net/>`_ provides C# signatures  for most existing WinAPI functions. The functions are listed there in alphabetical order and clustered by dynamic libraries. Full-text search is available. Copying ready made C# code is a faster and easier way to enable Windows API methods in PowerShell. Using the tested signatures from pinvoke.net reduces errors in source code.

The `page <http://www.pinvoke.net/default.aspx/user32/ShowWindowAsync.html>`_ of the **ShowWindowAsync** function at pinvoke.net contains the following С# signature:

.. code-block:: csharp

    [DllImport("user32.dll")]
    static extern bool ShowWindowAsync(IntPtr hWnd, int nCmdShow);

In the example above, **BOOL** in C/C++ has been coverted into **bool** in .NET, the **HWND** handle – into **IntPtr**, and **int** has not been changed.

Now declare a variable and set it according to the C# signature:

.. code-block:: PowerShell

    $Signature = @"
    [DllImport("user32.dll")]
    public static extern bool ShowWindowAsync(IntPtr hWnd, int nCmdShow);
    "@

The signature is saved in the **$Signature** variable and the **public** key-word is added to the signature code. That is required to make the new method available in the current PowerShell session.

Then use the **Add-Type** cmdlet to add a new type and saved it in a variable. The cmdlet must get the variable with C# signature, the **name** and the **namespace** of the type as parameters.

.. code-block:: PowerShell

    $ShowWindowAsync = Add-Type -MemberDefinition $Signature -Name "Win32ShowWindowAsync" -Namespace Win32Functions -PassThru
 
The Add-Type cmdlet does not create an object for the method by default. That can be fixed by adding **PassThru**. Then the class can be called in the current PowerShell session using the name and the namespace assigned to the type: '[Win32Functions.Win32ShowWindowAsync]'.

Here is how to address the static method of a WinAPI function that is now available in the PowerShell session:

.. code-block:: PowerShell

    $ShowWindowAsync::ShowWindowAsync((Get-Process -Id $pid).MainWindowHandle, 2)

Calling a static .NET method requires two colons between the variable name and the method. In the example above, the method of the **ShowWindowAsync** function is used to minimize the active window. The **Get-Process** cmdlet uses **$pid** variable to get the ID of the current PowerShell session process. Then the **ShowWindowAsync** method sets the main window handle to '2' to minimize it.

Similar source code can be used for adding a function to PowerShell. Save a relevant script in user profile to make the method available during the future sessions.

Extracting private .NET methods
----------------------------------

.NET uses Windows API functions. The framework calls them from the loaded dynamic libraries using private static methods with the **DllImport** attribute.

Windows PowerShell allows to write a script or a function that will search for the required WinAPI method in the loaded DLLs. Here is an example of such `function <https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/use-powershell-to-interact-with-the-windows-api-part-2/>`_:

.. code-block:: PowerShell
    
    function Find-WinAPIFunction
    {
         [CmdletBinding()]
         [OutputType([System.Reflection.MethodInfo])]
         Param
         (
             [Parameter(Mandatory = $True, Position = 0)]
             [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
             [String]
             $Module,
             [Parameter(Mandatory = $True, Position = 1)]
             [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
             [String]
             $FunctionName
         )
         [System.AppDomain]::CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies() |
            ForEach-Object { $_.GetTypes() } |
                ForEach-Object { $_.GetMethods('NonPublic, Public, Static') } |
                    ForEach-Object { $MethodInfo = $_; $_.GetCustomAttributes($false) } |
                        Where-Object {
                            $MethodInfo.Name.ToLower() -eq $FunctionName.ToLower() -and
                            $_.Value -eq $Module
                        } | ForEach-Object { $MethodInfo }
    }


For example, this function can find the **CopyFile** method in **kernel32.dll** and determine its containers. Declare a variable **$CopyFile** and set it to the search results for 'CopyFile' in **kernel32.dll** from **Find-WinAPIFunction**:

.. code-block:: PowerShell

    $CopyFile = Find-WinAPIFunction kernel32.dll CopyFile


If there are multiple entries, the function will save a massive of results in the variable. To use the first result only: 

.. code-block:: PowerShell

    $CopyFile = $CopyFile[0]

Then discover the containing module and type:

.. code-block:: PowerShell

    $CopyFile.Module.Name
    $CopyFile.DeclaringType.FullName


The PowerShell window will display the following:

.. image:: _static/1.png


 
The **CopyFile** method is in the **Microsoft.Win32.Win32Native** type of the **mscorlib.dll** library. Now you can add a function that will call the method by extracting it from the containing dynamic library and type. An example of such function can be found `here <https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Copy-RawItem-Private-NET-78917643>`_ .

Using reflection
----------------------

Reflection is another way of calling the methods of WinAPI functions in PowerShell environment. First, type introspection is performed, which is discovering methods and properties of a function. The most obvious way to do that in PowerShell is the **Get-Member** cmdlet. Then the collected data is used to generate code dynamically.

In order to understand the process of reflection and dynamic code generation, one should think of the current system environment as a structure of nested containers. The highest level is **AppDomain** of the PowerShell session. It contains multiple assemblies. Assemblies contain modules, i.e. DLLs. Modules are containers for types. Finally, types contain members that are subject for reflection. Members include methods, properties, nested types, and events.

The concept of generating code dynamically is to define all elements of the nested structure. First, a dynamic assembly is defined within the current **AppDomain**. Then a dynamic module, a dynamic type and a dynamic method must be defined progressively. The dynamic method is assigned **Public** and **Static** attributes, as well as a custom **DllImport** attribute. Finally, the CreateType method is applied to make the new dynamically defined method available for the current PowerShell session.

`Here <https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Copy-RawItem-Reflection-38fae6d4>`_  you can find an example of the function, that implements the abovementioned process.

Making the choice
------------------

The **Add-Type** cmdlet is the simplest and the least error prone way to make WinAPI functions available in PowerShell environment. This method is sufficient for accessing most functions of the system DLL’s.

But using the **Add-Type** cmdlet requires writing temporary files to disk and calling csc.exe – the C# compiler. That may be undesirable when zero footprint is necessary. In such cases extraction of .NET methods is preferable.

Finally, reflection may do the job if the required WinAPI function is not present in the loaded part of .NET framework or is contained in a DLL that is not accessible from the current Windows PowerShell session.
